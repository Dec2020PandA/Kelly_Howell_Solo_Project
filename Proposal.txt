Engineer's Toolbox 

This will be an information based website with discussion forums for various fields of study
involved in engineering such as Physics, Electrical, Thermodynamic, and Fluid Mechanics.
 ---- MVP Features ----
   - Login / Registration page

   - Each field will have a dedicated page with discussion board where users can start and 
     contribute to threads

   - useful apps, for starters, a live "trajectory calculator" on the physics page that
     will take user inputs and plot the motion of a projectile on a graph.

   - apps will be available to non registered users, but only logged in users will be able
     to use the discussion boards. 

 ---- Backlog ----
   - Add a commonly used equation and variables section to each page
   
   - Entropy value lookup table for Thermodynamics page
   
   - Reynolds number calculator / Moody Chart for Fluid Mechanics page
